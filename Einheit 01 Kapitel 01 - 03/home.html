                    “If I had a candy factory filled with strange little 
                    green-haired orange-skinned employees that helped 
                    make my magical sweets, I would totally want a waterfall 
                    made of THIS…” said AJ right after he took a sip of a salted 
                    caramel drink at a Meals on Wheels fundraiser we had 
                    attended a few years ago. I immediately made a mental 
                    note to reverse-engineer it when I got home.<br> Of course 
                    I never got around to doing that as I’m utterly filled 
                    with good intentions that are rarely realized. In truth, 
                    I have a crazy long laundry list of recipes and ideas that 
                    I want to attempt but have never really get to. Thankfully 
                    I finally decided it was time to whip up the caramel drink 
                    in our kitchen this past weekend and immediately wondered 
                    how our lives were ever complete without it!

                    As all the other Drip Cakes I have made so far has used chocolate, 
                    I decided to go with a salted caramel sauce. I used Carnations 
                    Caramel from the supermarkets as its ready made, and perfect for 
                    the buttercream and drip. I loosened my caramel as mentioned in 
                    the method, but used some Disposable Piping Bags to do the drip, 
                    like I do in all of my cakes. I use the Disposable Piping Bags for 
                    ALL of my drizzles whether its on cupcakes, cheesecakes, or drip 
                    cakes.. its so much easier to use a little disposable bag which you 
                    can just snip the end off and use, and then chuck away!<br>
                    I only cut off about 1/3cm on the end of the bag, and edge it over 
                    to create the drips. I don’t push each drip that far at all as the 
                    caramel drips further than a chocolate ganache will, and you don’t 
                    want it to puddle tooooo much at the bottom!<br>
                    I decided to add the stereotypical ‘Jane’s Patisserie’ flair to my 
                    cake by piping round the cake with some of the leftover buttercream, 
                    adding loads of Rolos, and then some fudge and chocolate sprinkles. 
                    I just can’t resist it! I love Drip Cakes, and I love caramel.. 
                    this is obvious, but I love it. I seriously hope you love this 
                    recipe as much as I do, enjoy!
